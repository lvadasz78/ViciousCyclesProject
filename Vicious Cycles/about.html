    <p>Vicious Cycles Inc is a Raleigh-based cycle workshop that was founded by a few like-minded individuals in late 2010.
    Our Mission is to create and foster a strong passion for the local biking scene.  Every one of us here at Vicious Cycles is a
    biking enthusiast.  We know that not every bike is right for every person.  That's why we decided to give bikers the ability
    to create and customize their own bicycles that are a perfect fit for them!  We also understand how difficult it can be with 
    the economy the way it is, so we make sure everything is at an affordabe price that way you don't have to sacrafice the thing 
    you love to do.  We strive to share the love of biking with everyone who is passionate about the sport.
